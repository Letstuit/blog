[OpenML](https://www.openml.org) is an open source platform where you can host, review, and organize machine learning datasets, algorithms, and experiments through clean and open interfaces. It connects and organizes all information so that you can easily build on it. We believe in making machine learning more streamlined, accessible, and beneficial to all of humanity.

This blog brings you stories about OpenML: why we want to streamline machine learning research, how you can use it, and what we are doing. 
We are also open to contributions about anything related to open machine learning research, education, and applications.

We hope you find it interesting and that you will join the conversation!
